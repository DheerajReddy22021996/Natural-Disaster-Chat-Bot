Hi Dheeraj2202,

I believe, it is fine to assume that people in disaster zone will have Internet / cell phone network access after disaster. At least in populated areas it is relatively easy to restore the network shortly after disaster. There are emergency power supply systems:

And rapid deployment units for cell network:

Thus, it should not be a problem
